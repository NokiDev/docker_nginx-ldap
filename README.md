# docker_nginx-ldap

NGINX with LDAP support docker image.
This image was highly inspired from : https://github.com/hrak/nginx-ldap

I just wanted to upload something for the community since nginx with ldap support seems to have disappear. 
This time I'll upload the images via Github ghcr.io.



I'll try to follow and update this image but don't hesitate to fork this repo if I'm not fast enough to handle your request.
